    <h2> Sweet potato fries don't have to be a guilty pleasure! Here is an easy 
        no-fry recipe that only requires sweet potatoes, oil, and spices. </h2>
        <p> The hardest part of this recipe is chopping the sweet potatoes. 
            Once that's done, you simply lather them in oil, add spice and herbs,
            and throw them in the oven for 30-45 minutes. If you have an air fryer,
            the whole process is even faster and easier.

        <p> <strong> Estimated total prep and cooking time: 40 minutes- 1 hour </strong></p> 
        <br>
    <h2> Ingredients</h2>
        <ul> 
            <li> 4 medium sweet potatoes (I estimate 
                one sweet potato per person) </li>
            <li> 3 cloves of garlic </li>
            <li> 2 tsp thyme </li>
            <li> 2 tsp rosemary </li>
            <li> 1 tsp cayenne pepper
            <li> Ground black pepper and sea salt, to taste </li>
            <li> Olive oil </li>
        
        </ul>
    <h2> Steps </h2>
        <ol>
            <li> Preheat the oven to 425 degrees. Wash your sweet potatoes and dry them well. Cut them in half
                length-wise so that you can lay each half flat on the cutting board.
                Then chop them into 1/2 inch wide fries, each about 2-3 inches long.
                I like to leave the skin on the potatoes, as it gives the fries an 
                extra crunch, but many prefer to peel them first.
            </li> <br>
            <li> Place the fries in a large mixing bowl and add the oil, garlic, 
                and spices. Toss them in the bowl until they are evenly coated in oil
                and seasonings. 
            </li> <br>
            <li> Move the fries to a metal baking sheet and into the oven. After about 
                20 minutes, take the sheet out and toss/flip the fries so that they don't 
                stick and can get crispy on all sides. After about 35-40 minutes total, 
                they should be the right consistency.
            </li> <br>
            <li> Remove from the oven and enjoy with a sauce/dip of your choice. 
            </li> 
        </ol>
